		<h1>Trotly</h1>
		<h2>Web Application</h2>
		<p>Trotly creates an instant online journal of your travels.</p>
		<p>This is a project that I came up with in 2011 as a means of seeing your travels in a convient format, an modern journal. 
		Seeing as how we're already posting to various social networks like Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, etc... I felt it would be best served to leverage that media.
		The way it works is Trotly will connect with these networks networks and pulling photos, statuses and locations then sorts through and lays them out in a convienent grid.
